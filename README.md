# PETSCIDO

An homage to a masterpiece of a solitaire game originally designed by Martin
Nedergaard Andersen and released in 2016 by Helvetiq.  For rules refer to https://helvetiq.com/media/hexaattachment/products/attachments/bandido_rules_WEB.pdf
(404) or better yet https://www.gameon.cafe/Pdf/GameInstructions/Bandido_EN.pdf

Anyone who grew up with a VIC, VIC-II or TED Commodore computer in the 1980s
recognizes that the built-in low resolution graphics characters map perfectly
onto the 1x2 tile cards.  Although scrolling past the screen limits is supported,
many games can even fit on a tiny grid of 40x24 or even 22x22 at once.

Requires the 64TASS assembler to build. Supports the following platforms already

* unexpanded VIC-20 (with reduced error checking)

* Commodore 64, SX-64

* Commodore Plus/4, 16 (suggest defining F1="1" F2="2" F3="3" with KEY command)

* Commodore P500, CBM 510 (with RAM installed in bank 15 beyond $0400 to $07ff)

Helvetiq holds all rights to this card game, which you should purchase to
support the original creator.  Neither entity was involved with PETSCIDO,
whose author disclaims any rights to the property it is based on.  He merely
taught his Commodore collection how to let him play it onscreen.
